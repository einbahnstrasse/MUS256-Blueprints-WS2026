Although it's been published on our site this semester, a gentle reminder that the written portion of our final exma will be distributed on **Friday, December 5, 2025**. You can read more about this exam [here.](https://einbahnstrasse.github.io/MUS218A-Soundscapes-FA2025/assignments/final-exam/){:target="_blank"}      

Use this study guide to prepare for the exam, which covers concepts and terminology given each week and listed on our weekly schedule. The study guide provides a few sample questions representing the types of short answer questions that you might encounter on the exam iteself.    

Note: You should not try to memorize all of these terms. It's a long list. But you should be familiar enough to answer questions _about them_, based on your reading, listening, watching the tutorial videos, and experience working with these concepts in our class projects.   

Definitions for all of these terms have purposefully not been provided. Complete the study guide on your own. Your study notes from class lectures, our readings, and videos should help you fill in what is missing.

# Week 1 — What Is Sound? / Microphones & Recording Basics

## frequency
Vibrations per second; determines perceived pitch. Measured in Hertz (cycles per second)

## pitch
The auditory perception of frequency, experienced as high or low. Pitch is perceived along a linear scale and can be easily measured in cents (100 equidistant cents between half-steps), or in MIDI pitch values (0-127 for each half step).

## amplitude
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## period
The time it takes for one full cycle of a periodic waveform (e.g., one cycle of a sine wave before the waveform repeats).

## harmonics    
Whole-number multiples of a fundamental frequency, which, when added together along with non-harmonic or noisy partials, determines a complex sound’s timbre (i.e., sound color). Sounds with louder upper harmonics may sound bright or distorted; sounds rich in lower harmonics may sound warm, balanced, or less complex. 

## fundamental
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## overtones
Frequencies above the fundamental that contribute to timbre; includes both harmonic and non-harmonic partials.

## oscillation
Repetitive variation around an equilibrium point.

## mass-spring system
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## simple harmonic motion
Smooth, repeating oscillation caused by a restoring force.

## coil
A wire inside a dynamic microphone that converts motion into electricity.

## diaphragm
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## polar pattern
The directional sensitivity area of a microphone. For example, a cardioid pattern accepts sound that is on-axis from the front of the mic, but rejects most of the sound at its rear, as opposed to an omni pattern, which accepts sound from all angles around the mic. (The Cardioid polar pattern is so named because its shape resembles a heart.)

## cardioid
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## omni
A polar pattern that captures sound equally from all directions.

## figure-8
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## XLR cable
A balanced, 3-pin cable used for transmitting audio signals cleanly, without electrical interference.

## balanced audio
Audio carried on a cable using differential signaling to reduce noise and interference.

## unbalanced audio
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## cable coiling
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## condenser mic
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## dynamic mic
A microphone using a moving coil; durable and versatile. Does not require phantom power. Usually these mics are considered to be more “rugged,” easily withstanding live sound contexts where they might encounter accidental falls, etc.

## audio interface
A device that converts analog sound to digital audio and back. Used to “interface” your computer with analog sound from mics, instrument cables, MIDI peripheral devices, etc.

## gain staging
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## clipping distortion
Harsh distortion caused by exceeding the maximum audio level of 0dBFS.

## proximity effect
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## plosives
Low-frequency “pops” from bursts of air hitting a microphone, often associated with spoken or sung consonant sounds, where turbulent air is rapidly released and hits a microphone. A pop filter is usually placed in front of a microphone to help soften these effects.

## sibilance
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

---

## Sample Questions 

- In your own words, explain the difference between frequency and amplitude, and describe how each one affects what you hear.
- What is the proximity effect, and why might a singer need to be aware of it when using a directional microphone in the studio?
- Compare a dynamic microphone and a condenser microphone. Name one situation where each type would be especially useful and explain why.
- Define clipping distortion. What causes it, and how can you prevent it when recording with an audio interface?

# Week 2 — Sound File Treatments + Early Tape Music

## sine wave
A pure tone containing no harmonics, with an ideally smooth waveform.

## triangle wave
A waveform with an instantaneous change in direction that creates odd harmonics, which diminish quickly.

## sawtooth wave
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## square wave
A waveform that switches between low and high states, containing rich harmonics. The width of the square (period, or distance between the wave changing from low-to-high and back down from high-to-low) is called the duty cycle. In modular synthesis, square waves can be used as control voltage as a simple switching mechanism (c.f. trigger and gate signals) in addition to its sonic properties.

## musique concrète
Music created using recorded sounds gathered from the environment or made in a studio as its raw material (so-called “concrete sounds”).

## sound object
Pierre Schaffer’s term for a recorded sound treated as a compositional unit that can be understood on its own terms (without seeing its source) and compositionally transformed using “treatments.”

## reduced listening
Listening focused on the perception of an audio source’s sonic qualities alone, not its source or social context. In reduced listening, sonic qualities are considered apart from any distractions concerning the sound producing medium or its history.

## diffusion

# Week 4 — FX Plugins, Automation, Mixing

## sample rate
How many audio samples are recorded from an input source, or rendered by an audio interface for output to speakers, per second. Standard CD-quality audio uses a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz, but audio production requires higher sampling rates. In our class, 48,000 Hz is our standard production sampling rate.

## Nyquist frequency
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## aliasing
Distortion caused when frequencies above the Nyquist limit are folded back into the audible range.

## bit depth
The number of bits used to represent audio amplitude, analogous to pixels: the more you have, the better “resolution” you have. In this case, the higher the bit rate, the more accurately the audio portrays the original fidelity and changes in loudness within a waveform’s shape.

## headroom
The amount of space between nominal signal level and the clipping point.

## metering
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## auxiliary track
A track used to host shared effects. One or many tracks may send copies of their audio to an aux track for parallel processing.

## pre-fader send
An effects send taken before the channel fader, used in some cases to separate wet from dry sound on separate tracks with their own faders. In pre-fader mode, changes to the source track’s fader position will not effect the amount of signal sent to an aux track. To couple the source track’s fader movement with the amount sent to an aux track, use a post-fader mode.

## automation modes
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## stems
Individual tracks designed to function in a multichannel summation. These can be the individual tracks in a Reaper session that are designed to be mixed in some way, or they can be the individual speaker feeds in your final output mix from SpatGris.

## routing
The assignment of audio signals through tracks, buses, effects, and outputs.

## tonal balance
Generally, tonal balance denotes how frequencies are distributed in a mix. Since higher frequencies are perceived to be louder, balancing louder lower frequencies and softer higher frequencies creates a sense of warmth and balance in most mixing situations.

## EQ
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## pan
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## compressor
A processor that reduces or expands overall dynamic range, making it possible to amplify the smaller details of a sound source at the cost of a higher dynamic range. Parallel compression allows the producer to mix the original, uncompressed audio on one track with an automated, compressed version on a parallel track, providing balanced compromise between the wet and dry versions of the signal.

## limiter

## downward compression
Reducing the volume of sounds that are above a set threshold, thereby decreasing dynamic range.   

## upward expansion
Amplifing signals above a certain threshold, thereby increasing dynamic range. 

## downward expansion
Reducing the volume of quiet sounds, thereby increasing dynamic range.

## filter
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## delay
A time-based repetition effect, where a copy of an audio signal is typically mixed with the original, but the copy starts at some interval later. Delays with very short lengths may cause destructive and constructive interference, which will naturally filter out some frequencies while amplifying others.

## transposition
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## rotate
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## onset
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## expand/compress

## slicer tool
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## amplitude envelope
Shape of a sound’s loudness over time. ADSR refers to the natural evolution of a sound event in electronic music: attack, sustain, decay, and release. Changing these parameters will change the sonic character of the sound source. With a shorter attack and a lower sustain level, it may sound more percussive due to sudden loudness at the start of the sound. But with a longer attack and a higher sustain, the sound may come closer to a steady-state oscillation.

## field recording
Capturing environmental sound outside the studio using portable microphones and recorders.

## microphone placement
The positioning of microphones in relation to environmental sound sources, affecting clarity, stereo image, and noise.

# Week 8 — Modular Synthesis

## oscillator
An analog module (or digital unit generator in software) that produces continuous periodic waveforms.

## VCO
A voltage-controlled oscillator in the format of a module, where voltage can modulate its pitch and other parameters. Some VCOs include multiple basic waveforms and not just a simple sine wave output.

## control voltage or CV
Control Voltage (CV) is a form of direct current (DC) used to control parameters in a modular synthesizer, such as pitch, amplitude, filter cutoff, modulation depth, and timing. Unlike audio signals, which are typically alternating current (AC) waveforms designed to be heard, CV is meant to modulate synthesis parameters rather than produce sound directly.

## amplifier

## trigger
A short pulse signal that may be used to begin a process or as the onset of another event.

## inverter vs. attenuverter
An inverter flips the polarity of a signal, and an attenuverter scales and flips it.

## LFO
— _(Find this one on your own.)_ —      

## DC voltage
Direct current: a constant control voltage whose value can be dynamically varied and used to change module behavior.

## complex oscillator
Two or more oscillators designed for cross-modulation, capable of producing diverse timbres. Usually, frequency modulation (FM) is involved. 

## cross modulation
Mutual modulation between oscillators.

## Sample Questions

- In a modular synthesizer, what is an oscillator and how does control voltage (CV) influence it? Include the meaning of VCO in your answer.
- Explain the difference between a gate and a trigger. How might each be used to control an envelope such as an ADSR?

## transaural
The condition in speaker-based listening where audio from one speaker is also heard by the opposite ear, preventing perfect channel separation.
