## Deadline: Week 3: {{ site.week-03 }}  

### What To Do   

Write down **a detailed list of 25 sounds** documenting what you hear by following the guidelines below.  

**Send me an email** with your list by the deadline.     

### How to Do It     

From a single listening position inside your home, sit quietly and observe the sounds around you.   

Concentrate hard, shifting your attention actively.  

Try as best as you can to **identify each sound** and **identify its “source” (where the sound comes from)** relative to your listening position. 

#### Consider the following...     

* Which sounds seem to _change over time?_  
* Which sounds are _unchanging?_     
* Which sounds have their own _internal movement?_     
* Do any of your sounds _mimic musical elements?_ Chords, arpeggios, melodies, rhythms, instruments, white noise?   
* Do any of your sounds seem to be _working together?_     
* Can you hear _distant locations?_    
* Are any of the sounds from very _large sources? Very small?_      

Feel free to make notes on any observations that answer these questions or others that interest you, but don't feel obligated to write too much!  

Identifying the first 10 sounds will be easy. After that, the next 10 will get progressively more difficult, and the last 5 will be almost impossible. Push yourself... For example, if you hear 2 cars go by, what makes each of them sound different? If it's the sound of people talking, ignore the words and describe the sound of their voices.  

### Why Do This??  

**The human brain ignores more than 80% of the sounds around us.**  

It does this in order to focus on a single task at hand.  

That means **becoming an expert listener** is all about learning to actively turn on + off this **selective perception**.

## Introduction  
The purpose of this assignment is to sharpen your ability to listen critically and attentively to your everyday environment while acknowledging the impact of your listening _position_ on your own _perception_. By cataloging a wide variety of sounds from a single listening position, you will begin to recognize qualities that normally escape notice.  

This exercise develops perceptual awareness and prepares you for later projects in field recording, sound design, and electroacoustic musical creation.  

---

## Learning Objectives  
By completing this assignment, students will be able to:  
1. **Identify** and describe diverse sound sources in their immediate and surrounding environment.  
2. **Differentiate** between sounds that are continuous, changing, or internally dynamic.  
3. **Analyze** sounds in terms of spatial location, size, and relation to other sounds.  
4. **Recognize** musical analogies in environmental sounds (rhythm, pitch, timbre, texture).  
5. **Demonstrate** active listening strategies that go beyond selective and automatic, everyday perception.  

---

## Assignment Instructions  

1. From a **single listening position inside your home**, sit quietly and observe the sounds around you. Concentrate hard, shifting your attention actively.  
2. Write down a **detailed list of 25 sounds** you hear, including each sound’s **source** (where you think it comes from) relative to your position.  
3. Pay close attention to the following:  
   - Which sounds change over time?  
   - Which sounds remain unchanging?  
   - Which sounds have their own internal movement?  
   - Do any sounds mimic musical elements (like chords, rhythms, melodies, instruments, or noise textures)?  
   - Do any sounds seem to _interact_ or work together?  
   - Can you hear distant _locations_, or sounds from very large or very small places?  
4. The first 10 sounds will be easy to identify; the next 10 will be more challenging; the last 5 may seem almost impossible. Push yourself to perceive subtle differences (e.g., two cars passing, different vocal timbres, etc. What makes them distinct?).  
5. **Submit your list on Lyceum via the given link** by the deadline.

## Why This Matters  
The human brain filters out the majority of ambient sound to help us focus on the tasks at hand. By some measures, this amounts to more than 80% of the sound within our immediate environment! Training yourself to **notice ignored sounds** is fundamental for becoming a skilled sound artist, field recordist, or composer. This assignment is an exercise in shifting your perception and expanding auditory awareness.  

---

## Evaluation Criteria  
Your work will be assessed on the following:  
- **Completeness (20%)** — A full list of 25 sounds submitted by the deadline.  
- **Detail & Specificity (30%)** — Each sound clearly described with identifiable qualities or sources.  
- **Perceptual Depth (30%)** — Evidence of close listening and differentiation (e.g., subtle contrasts, spatial awareness).  
- **Engagement with Prompts (20%)** — Notes reflect consideration of questions about change, movement, musical analogies, or interaction.
