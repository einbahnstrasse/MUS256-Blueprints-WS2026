## Deadline  
**start of Week 5: {{ site.week-05 }}**   

---

## Introduction  
In this collaborative exercise, the class will work in teams to create a **comprehensive sample library of the Bates gamelan**. Each team will be responsible for recording a group of assigned instruments from the Bates gamelan room.  

This assignment develops skills in microphone placement, gain staging, recording, file editing, and documentation. The end result will be a **shared, well-organized sample library** that you and your classmates can use in later projects, which can be made available to future generations of Bates Sound Studio musical creators as well.     

---

## Learning Objectives  
By completing this assignment, students will be able to:  
1. **Demonstrate** careful microphone placement and gain staging in a live room environment.  
2. **Perform** basic percussion technique on gamelan instruments by striking and damping correctly.
3. **Capture** multiple types of strikes and excitation methods across a family of gamelan instruments.  
4. **Apply** consistent editing practices so that samples start with a clear attack and end after the natural resonance fades.  
5. **Organize** files according to a strict naming convention for usability.  
6. **Collaborate** in teams to contribute to a class-wide sample library.

## Assignment Instructions  

### Step 1: Team Assignments  
- The class will be divided into **teams**, each responsible for a group of gamelan instruments (e.g., saron, bonang, kenong, gongs).  
- Each team ensures **all pitches** in their assigned group are recorded and indexed. To be sure, your task is to record all notes available on your assigned instruments, at different dynamic levels and using different playing tecnniques (as described below).    

#### Teams and Instruments      

See the photos with labeled instruments below. The teams are as follows, and the instruments are assigned to the following teams. Find the instrument(s) you will be recording in the photos that follow:

### Step 2: Recording Setup  
- Use a recording kit checked out from the Bates Sound Studio.     
- Set gain to avoid clipping while preserving dynamics. Aim for peaks around **–12 to -8 dBFS**.  
- Place microphones thoughtfully, aiming for the most dry/direct sound you can capture:  
- Avoid room bleed, background noise, air duct hum and "room tone," recorder and microphone handling noise, etc.  

### Step 3: Required Recordings  
For **each pitch** of each instrument:  
- Record multiple **dynamic levels** (pp, mf, ff).  
- Record multiple **note lengths** (short damped, sustained until resonance fades).  
- Record different **excitation methods** (mallet types, muted vs. open, scrapes or rolls).  
- **Photograph** and **index** the instruments and mallets or excitors that you use, which will be included with the sample library.   
    
### Step 4: Editing  
- Import recordings into Reaper.  
- **Trim** so that the file begins exactly at the attack.  
- **Short fade out** after the resonance has fully decayed.  
- Do not apply processing to the sound (e.g., no noise reduction, EQ, etc.), preserving the natural sound.  
- Export each sample as **WAV, 48 kHz / 24-bit**.  

### Step 5: Naming Convention  
All files must follow this structure:  

`instrument-playingMode-note-dynamics-optionalOthers.wav`   

- **instrument** = instrument name (e.g., `saron`, `bonang`, `kenong`)  
- **playingMode** = type of strike / excitation (e.g., `open`, `muted`, `roll`, `scrape`)  
- **note** = pitch (e.g., `E4`, `A3`)  
- **dynamics** = dynamic marking (`pp`, `mf`, `ff`)  
- **optionalOthers** = optional extra descriptor (e.g., mallet type, room, initials)  

**Examples:**  
- `saron-open-C4-mf.wav`  
- `bonang-muted-G3-ff.wav`  
- `largeGong1-roll-B2-pp-hardMallet.wav`  

By adhering strictly to this convention, we can write software that automatically detects and organizes our samples according to the file's metadata. Ensure the dash character `-` is only used to separate these metadata fields and appears nowhere else in the file name.     

### Step 6: Submission  
- Create a folder for each instrument your team sampled, and put all samples and photos relating to that instrument inside this folder.  
- Place your team’s folders (containing all edited sounds and photos) into a single "master folder" labeled: `TeamName_Instrument`.  
- Submit your team's _"master folder"_ to the shared class drive by the deadline.  
- All teams’ files will be consolidated into a **master class sample library**.  

### Step 7: (Optional) Try Sampler   

Load any of your samples into the Reaper sampler to test their usability. Experiment with transfomring the sounds using sampler paramters.
