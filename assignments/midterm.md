## Deadline: Week 7: {{ site.week-07 }}  

The midterm is a “sketch” for a fixed-media piece, which you can treat as a “preview” of your final piece as you are developing your ideas.  

Of course, you can choose to treat this as an entirely separate piece, or even abandon this material for an alternate plan for your final piece, but the option to make this a “miniature” version of your final piece is given.   

This is a chance for you to explore some of the sounds that interest you, perhaps even make your own field recordings or synthesis, and showcase your mixing and automation technique.  

By the deadline, send me a soundfile and your Reaper project folder (by email, WeTransfer.com, or any cloud link) meeting the following criteria:  

### Criteria   

* Ideally, your sketch is around **3-minutes in duration**, but of course, this **may vary** depending on your material and your compositional approach. It can be a longer excerpt, but not much shorter.  
* Prepare your sketch **in a Reaper session**. Any sound files you use should also be contained inside your Reaper project folder.  
* Sketches should be your own, original work, focusing on your manipulation of the source sounds that interest you.  
* Include **at least 2 source sound files** and/or synthesis clips.  
* Your Reaper project should include a sequence that **utilizes multiple tracks** (at least 4).  
* Your Reaper tracks should include **automation**.  
* These tracks may include any number of **plugin** devices.  
* If you use plugins, include a **list** of them: _Your mix must be transferrable and able to play on another computer._  
* Strive for **tonal balance in your mix**. For example, use **EQ** and **compression** to improve the interaction between the sounds in your tracks.   
* Sound files and samples should be exported at a **sample rate of 48 kHz** and a **bit rate of 24 bits** (48 kHz / 24 bits).   

_Note that we will not be having class during the day of the deadline._   -->

## Deadline  
**Due at the start of Week 9: {{ site.week-09 }}**

## Introduction  
Our midterm assignment is a **sketch** for a fixed-media piece, which can serve as a “preview” of your final project. By "sketch," we simply mean _a working version:_ not final, not perfect.   

You may treat this as:  
- A **miniature version** of your final piece,  
- An **independent study** in sound that diverges from your final project, or  
- A **testing ground** for ideas you may or may not carry forward.  

This is a chance to explore particular sound material that really interest you, experiment with your **field recordings**, **software plugins and/or synthesizers** and **samplers**, borrow any approaches or concepts you may have found useful from our work in **micromontage**, **modular synthesis**, or **frequency domain resynthesis**, and demonstrate your developing skills in **mixing** and **automation**.  

---

## Learning Objectives  
By completing this assignment, students will be able to:  
1. **Identify** and organize diverse sound sources (field recordings, synthesis, samples) for compositional use.  
2. **Apply** mixing techniques (EQ, tonal balance, gain staging, compression where appropriate) in a Reaper session.  
3. **Demonstrate** creative use of automation to shape dynamics, timbre, and spatial qualities.  
4. **Construct** a multi-track session (minimum 4 tracks) that integrates multiple sound sources into a cohesive sketch.  
5. **Evaluate** the effectiveness of their mix for clarity, balance, and expressivity.  
6. **Produce** a stereo audio file (48 kHz / 24-bit) and a transferable Reaper session folder that can be opened in another computer system.  

---

## Assignment Criteria  
Your submission should meet the following guidelines:  

- **Length:** Approximately 3 minutes in duration (slightly longer is acceptable; significantly shorter is not).  
- **Reaper Session:** Your project folder must contain all audio and Reaper session files.  
- **Source Materials:** Include at least **2 sound sources** (recorded or synthesized).  
- **Tracks:** Use a minimum of **4 tracks** in Reaper.  
- **Automation:** At least one form of automation (e.g., volume, panning, a plugin parameter, etc.) must be present and intentionally thought out. That is, don't simply move automation randomly to satisy this part of the assignment; your automation should demonstrate that it has purpose linked, ideally, to your own listening.     
- **Plugins:** Any plugins used must be listed so the session can be recreated on another computer.  
- **Mixing:** Strive for **tonal balance** using EQ and dynamics processing.  
- **Export Format:** 48 kHz / 24-bit WAV file.  

---

## Submission Instructions  
- Submit your **Reaper project folder** (with all audio files included in your mix, plus your Reaper session file(s)) **and** your exported stereo soundfile.  
- Send via Etna, or by email via WeTransfer or a preferred cloud storage link.  
- Due by **Week 7: {{ site.week-07 }}**.

## Evaluation Criteria  
Your midterm will be evaluated according to the following:  

- **Completeness (20%)** — Meets all technical requirements (mix duration, minimum number of tracks, file formats, Reaper project folder in tact).  
- **Sound Source Use (20%)** — Incorporates at least 2 distinct sources creatively, using transformations of the sounds that show intention and inventiveness.  
- **Automation (15%)** — Evidence of thoughtful automation shaping dynamic, timbral, and/or spatial qualities.  
- **Mix Quality (25%)** — Attention to tonal balance, EQ, and clarity of layers, or blend, where required.  
- **Creativity & Originality (20%)** — Demonstrates a personal approach to your chosen material, exploratory or expressive use of sound.
